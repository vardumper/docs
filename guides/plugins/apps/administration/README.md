# Administration

You can't extend the Shopware administration by means of freely overiding and exending administration components, all js files you provide in the `Resources/administration` namespace will be ignored. Instead, you have more defined extension points and can extend the administration by other means: You are able to [add your own modules](add-custom-modules.md), [custom fields ](../custom-data.md)or [action buttons ](add-custom-action-button.md)via manifest file.
